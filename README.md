## Description

_This is a portfolio website for for Portland-based painter and author Matty Byloos. It's based on the Rams theme by Anders Norén. I created a child theme to tweak the overall look to the artist's specifications. Among the changes: larger image sizes on screen resize, a more minimalist color palate, and changes to font size and appearance._
